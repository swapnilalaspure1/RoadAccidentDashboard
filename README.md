# RoadAccidentDashboard And Report

In this project, I have performed data analysis and create dashboard using Excel on the Road Accident Dataset..

Utilizing a Kaggle dataset, I performed comprehensive data analysis, transformation, and extraction in Excel. 
Employing diverse visualization tools, I constructed interactive dashboards featuring slicers for area-wise casualties, a dynamic timeline for year/month/quarterly casualties, and diverse charts such as KPIs, donut charts, and bar charts.
